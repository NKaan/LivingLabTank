Sci-Fi Sprite Props Package
This package contains a collection of 3D sci-fi props designed as 2D sprites, suitable for use in 2D or 3D games. The props are all low-poly and have been optimized for use in real-time rendering applications.

Getting Started
To use these props in your game, simply import the package into your Unity project. The package includes prefabs for each prop, along with materials and textures.

The prefabs are organized into subfolders based on their color variations: blue, green, purple, red, and yellow. Each subfolder contains prefabs for each prop with that particular color variation.

Prop List
The following props are included in this package:

Barrel (large and small)
Cube (large, regular, and small)
Hazard bottle
Monitor
Mug
Pipe (medium, small, and T-joint)
Pipe joint (medium and small)
Usage
To use a prop in your scene, simply drag and drop the corresponding prefab into the scene. You can then adjust the transform and material properties to suit your needs.

You can also create variations of the props by duplicating the prefab and modifying its material properties. The materials are included in the SpriteProps_Materials folder, organized by color variation.

Compatibility
This package is compatible with Unity 2019.4 and later.
