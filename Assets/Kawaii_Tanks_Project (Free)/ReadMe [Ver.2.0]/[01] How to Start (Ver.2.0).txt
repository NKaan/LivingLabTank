*** How to Start ***

(1) Create a new project, and import this package from Package Manager.
	Window >> Package Manager >> "My Assets".


(2) Switch the Platform when you need.
	Switch the platform to 'Android' or 'iOS' when you need touch controls.
	You can change the platform from the "Build Settings" (File >> Build Settings…).

(3) Play the demo scenes.
	You can find the demo scenes in the "Scenes" folder.
	I recommend playing the demo scene "Test_Field" at first.
